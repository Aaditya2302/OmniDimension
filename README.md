# üì¶ Client (Frontend)

A modern React app using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/).

### Main Folders

- `src/components/` ‚Äì Reusable UI components (e.g., TaskExecuter)
- `src/pages/` ‚Äì Page-level components (e.g., HomePage, LoginPage)
- `src/context/` ‚Äì Global state management (User, Auth, Task)
- `src/assets/` ‚Äì Static assets (SVGs, images)

---

## Contexts

### 1. `UserContext`
- **Purpose:** Provides `user` and `setUser` globally.
- **Usage:**  
  ```js
  const { user, setUser } = useContext(UserDataContext)
  ```
- **Server Response Example:**  
  ```json
  {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
  ```

### 2. `AuthContext`
- **Purpose:** Handles authentication logic (login, signup, logout) and syncs with `UserContext`.
- **Functions:**
  - `login(email, password)`
  - `signup(name, email, password)`
  - `logout()`
- **Usage:**  
  ```js
  const { login, signup, logout, user } = useAuth()
  ```

### 3. `TaskContext`
- **Purpose:** Manages the current medical task and address details for booking.
- **Functions:**
  - `setTask(task)`
  - `updateAddressDetails(field, value)`
- **Usage:**  
  ```js
  const { task, setTask, addressDetails, updateAddressDetails } = useTask()
  ```

---

## Pages

### 1. `HomePage`
- **Purpose:** Landing page, shows features, and allows navigation to login/signup or medical service.
- **Functions:**
  - `handleLogout`: Calls `/users/logout` (GET) on server, removes token, redirects to login.
- **Server Response Example:**
  ```json
  { "message": "Logged out successfully" }
  ```

### 2. `LoginPage`
- **Purpose:** User login form.
- **Functions:**
  - `submitHandler`: Sends POST to `/users/login` with email and password.
- **Server Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
  ```

### 3. `SignupPage`
- **Purpose:** User registration form.
- **Functions:**
  - `submitHandler`: Sends POST to `/users/register` with fullName, email, password.
- **Server Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
  ```

### 4. `MedicalServicePage`
- **Purpose:** Collects the user's medical service/task request.
- **Functions:**
  - `handleTaskSubmit`: Navigates to address details page if task is provided.

### 5. `AddressDetailPage`
- **Purpose:** Collects user's contact and address details.
- **Functions:**
  - `handleAddressSubmit`: Navigates to task execution page.

### 6. `TaskExecutionPage`
- **Purpose:** Simulates booking process and shows status updates.
- **Functions:**
  - Simulates status updates (no server call in current code).

### 7. `UserProtectedWrapper`
- **Purpose:** Protects routes that require authentication.
- **Functions:**
  - On mount, sends GET to `/users/profile` with JWT token.
  - If unauthorized, redirects to login.
- **Server Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "_id": "...",
    "fullName": "...",
    "email": "..."
  }
  ```

## Components

### 1. `TaskExecuter`
- **Purpose:** Multi-step UI for describing a medical task, entering address, and showing booking status.
- **Functions:**
  - Handles step navigation, form state, and simulates status updates.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Server (Backend)

A Node.js/Express REST API with MongoDB (via Mongoose), JWT authentication, and cookie/session management.

### Main Folders

- `controllers/` ‚Äì Route handlers (e.g., user registration, login)
- `models/` ‚Äì Mongoose schemas (User, BlacklistToken)
- `routes/` ‚Äì Express route definitions
- `middlewares/` ‚Äì Authentication middleware
- `services/` ‚Äì Business logic (e.g., user creation)
- `db/` ‚Äì Database connection logic

  ```json
  {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "fullName": "...", "email": "..." },
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
  ```

  {
    "errors": [
      { "msg": "Full name must be at least 3 characters", "param": "fullName" }

## üß© How It All Works

- **User flow:**  
  1. User signs up or logs in (JWT token issued and stored).
  2. User describes a medical need (e.g., "Book a dentist appointment").
  3. User provides contact/address details.
  4. System simulates booking and status updates.
  5. User can log out, which blacklists the JWT token.

- **Security:**  
  - JWT tokens are used for authentication.
  - Logout blacklists tokens to prevent reuse.
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
  - CORS and cookie management for secure cross-origin requests.

- **Extensibility:**  
  - The backend is ready for more agents (calendar, calling, etc.).
  - The frontend is modular, with clear separation of concerns.

---

## üìù Notes

- All authentication tokens are stored in `localStorage` as `"token"`.
- Most forms expect and handle server error messages for user feedback.
- All context providers must wrap the app in `main.jsx` for global state to work.
- The backend uses environment variables for secrets and DB connection.
